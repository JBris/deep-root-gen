Introduction
============

*A simulation model for the digital reconstruction of 3D root system architectures. Integrated with a simulation-based inference generative deep learning model.*

This repository contains an implementation of a simulation model for generating the root system architecture, for the estimation of root parameters as informed by observational data collected from the field.
